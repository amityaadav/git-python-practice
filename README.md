# git-practice

## Fundamentals
Working Directory  →  Staging Area  →  Local Repo  →  Remote
    (your files)       (git add)      (git commit)   (git push)

## Fetch vs. Pull
Fetch to download and then review before you merge to your local
Pull to download and merge to your local

Fetch = check your mailbox
Pull = check mailbox + open and read the mail
